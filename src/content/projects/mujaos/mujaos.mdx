### **Declarative. Modular. Reproducible.**

_A lightweight, flake-based NixOS configuration designed for modern systems and developers who value clarity, speed, and control._

---

## 🧩 Overview

**MujaOS** is more than just a NixOS configuration — it’s a **framework for reproducible Linux environments**.
Built on the power of Nix flakes, MujaOS turns the complex world of system configuration into something elegant, scalable, and maintainable.

Whether you’re setting up a personal workstation, deploying servers, or managing multiple devices, MujaOS ensures every build is **identical, version-controlled, and clean**.

> **Goal:** Deliver a modern, opinionated foundation for NixOS that balances flexibility with simplicity — perfect for both enthusiasts and professionals.

---

## ⚙️ Why MujaOS?

| Traditional NixOS                           | With MujaOS                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Manual configuration scattered across files | Modular structure with clear separation   |
| Rebuilding feels uncertain                  | Deterministic builds via flakes           |
| Hard to share between devices               | Multi-host & multi-user ready             |
| Customization is error-prone                | Safe, declarative modules with versioning |
| Setup knowledge barrier                     | Simplified onboarding and examples        |

MujaOS bridges the gap between **Nix purity** and **developer pragmatism**, making it accessible and production-ready.

---

## 🧠 Core Architecture

MujaOS is built with three key layers, making it modular yet cohesive:

1. **Flake Root (`flake.nix`)** — the project entrypoint defining dependencies, inputs, and outputs.
2. **Modules Layer (`modules/`)** — independent building blocks for services, networking, security, and UI.
3. **Hosts Layer (`hosts/`)** — defines individual systems (e.g., `laptop`, `server`, `desktop`) as unique compositions of modules.

Add optional layers for:

- **Users (`users/`)** — personalized development environments
- **Overlays (`overlays/`)** — extend or override package definitions

This design keeps your infrastructure composable, reusable, and easy to reason about.

> 🧩 Every host is just a collection of modules — plug in, remove, or swap components without breaking the system.

---

## ✨ Features at a Glance

- ⚙️ **Flake-based design** — self-contained, modern, and version-controlled
- 🧩 **True modularity** — services, hardware, and users separated cleanly
- 🌐 **Multi-host management** — run servers, desktops, and VMs from one repo
- 🔒 **Security-focused defaults** — hardened settings out of the box
- 🔁 **Reproducible builds** — deterministic and rollback-ready
- 🧰 **User profiles** — tailor user environments with zero overlap
- 🪶 **Minimal boilerplate** — human-readable structure built to scale

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mujaxso/mujaos.git
cd mujaos
```

### 2. Switch to your host configuration

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#laptop --show-trace
```

> Replace `laptop` with your host name (e.g. `server`, `desktop`, or `workstation`).

### 3. Reboot & enjoy

Once complete, reboot to load your fully declarative system.

## 🧭 Project Structure

```bash
mujaos/
├── flake.nix              # Main flake entrypoint
├── flake.lock             # Dependency lock file
├── hosts/                 # Host-specific definitions
│   ├── laptop/
│   └── server/
├── modules/               # Modular system components
├── users/                 # User configurations
├── overlays/              # Custom package overrides
├── assets/                # Images and docs
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

> Clean. Predictable. Extensible.
> You can add or remove hosts without affecting others — every system stays isolated yet maintainable.

---

## 🧰 Example Commands

Rebuild or switch configurations:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#desktop
```

Update inputs (Nixpkgs, Home Manager, etc.):

```bash
nix flake update
```

Test changes without applying:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild test --flake .#server
```

Rollback to previous generations:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild rollback
```

---

## 💬 Philosophy

MujaOS is founded on three principles:

- **Declarative by Design** — Systems should describe _what_ they are, not _how_ to become that.
- **Modular by Default** — Small, composable modules are easier to maintain.
- **Reproducible Forever** — Your system today should be buildable tomorrow — byte-for-byte identical.

> “If it can’t be rebuilt exactly, it’s not truly declarative.”

---

## 📈 Roadmap

**Upcoming Enhancements:**

- 🧩 Plug-and-play desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, Hyprland)
- ☁️ Remote provisioning via SSH and NixOps integration
- 🔄 Template generator for new hosts and modules
- 🧠 Documentation site with interactive examples
- 🧰 Cross-platform build support (x86_64 & aarch64)
